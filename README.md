# DebuggingMyBrain 🧠🐞

This repository is my journey of revisiting and refining **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Here I document my revisions, re-solves, and key learnings while practicing from Striver’s Sheet and other sources.  
The aim is not just solving problems, but **debugging my brain** and building strong problem-solving patterns.

## 📌 What's Inside
- ✅ Revised solutions from previous attempts  
- 📘 Key learnings & mistakes (and how I fixed them)  
- 🔑 Pattern-based notes (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, etc.)  
- 🚀 Progress from **Brute Force → Better → Optimal**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: **C++ (Primary)**  
- Platform: CodeStudio (Code360), Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef  
- Tools: GitHub Desktop, VS Code  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills  
- Build an organized reference of DSA concepts  
- Track my growth through consistent revision  
- Prepare for coding interviews by mastering patterns

## 📅 How I Use This Repo
- Each folder = Topic (Arrays, Strings, DP, etc.)  
- Inside → problems with code + short notes/insights  
- Commit messages describe what I learned in each revision

This repo is where I train my brain to think in **patterns**, not just individual problems.
