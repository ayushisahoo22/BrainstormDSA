//Subarrays With ‘K’ Distinct Values

//You are given an array ‘ARR’ having ‘N’ integers.
// You are also given an integer ‘K’. The task is to count the number of subarrays that have ‘K’ distinct values.
//Subarray: A consecutive sequence of one or more values taken from an array.

// ‘N’ = 4, ‘K’ = 2
// ‘ARR’ = [1, 1, 2, 3]
//There are ‘3’ subarrays with ‘2’ distinct elements, which are as follows: 
//[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 1, 2].
