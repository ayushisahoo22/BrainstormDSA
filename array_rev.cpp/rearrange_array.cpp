// Given an array ‘A’ having ‘N’ integers and an integer ‘m’. You need to rearrange the array elements such that after re-arrangement difference of array elements with ‘m’ should be in a sorted fashion.

// If the difference between any two array elements and ‘m’ is the same, then the element which comes first in the given array will be placed first in the re-arranged array.

// For Example
// If we have A =  [3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6]  and m = 5.
// Difference of array elements with m : [2, 0, 2, 4, 3, 1].
// Array after rearrangement : [5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 9].
